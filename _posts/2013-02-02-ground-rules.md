Here's the ground rules:

I'm going to tell you about the world in an article that looks something like
this. There might even be pictures sometimes.

![Lightning!](/images/lightning.jpg)

Throughout it all, There's going to be some side commentary going on in
<span>colored boxes</span>{:.info}. Different colors mean different things.

<aside class="info">
Like this. It's an info box, which is uncategorized commentary.
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
We also have <span>science boxes</span>{:.science},

<aside class="science">
They'll tell you about science experiments or clarify science points.
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
<span>math boxes</span>{:.math},

<aside class="math">
Where you can often find links to more rigorous proofs.
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
and <span>interdisciplinary boxes</span>{:.other}.

<aside class="other">
Where I leave notes to all you biologists, chemists, computer
scientists, musicians, artists, &amp; the rest of you out there.
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
We have <span>definition boxes</span>{:.define}, which are very important.

<aside class="define">
In these I define words that you might not know (or new phrases that I've made up).
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
We have <span>rigor boxes</span>{:.rigor}.

<aside class="rigor">
Where I let you know that I've been lying for the sake of simplicity.
</aside>

<hr class="mark">
Perhaps most importantly, we have <span>wrong boxes</span>{:.wrong} where
I discuss something that pervades common mathematics and science which is
nevertheless a *bad explanation*. They're wrong as in confusing, not necessarily
wrong as in incorrect.

<aside class="wrong">
$\pi$, $i$, $p=mv$, $e^{i\pi}=1$
<br/>
The force of gravity
<br/>
a squared + b squared = c squared
</aside>

I won't explain the wrong things in my main articles, nor will I explain why
they're wrong. I don't want to muddle the point. Red boxes are your indication
that the mainstream has something muddled.

<hr class="mark">
And, finally, we have <span>simplifience boxes</span>{:.simplifience}.

<aside class="simplifience">
Where I point out concepts that embody the spirit of simplifience.
</aside>
