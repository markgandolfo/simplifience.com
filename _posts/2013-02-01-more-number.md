So numbers are only as useful as what they can apply to.

Now, what can numbers do?

Well, we touched upon this a bit earlier. It depends upon the situation.

Take, for example, fractions. Often times, fractions make sense. When you and
your tribe of five have killed a woolly mammoth, for instance, it makes a lot of
sense to introduce the fraction "one fifth" into you vocabulary for numbers.

However, when your friend Thurg gets his top fifth eaten by a saber toothed
tiger, you don't suddenly have only three and four-fifths living friends. You
have three living friends.

Sometimes you're dealing with fractions, sometimes you aren't.

And this combination -- whole numbers and fractions -- is sufficient to describe
everything you will find in the world. <span>Literally
everything.</span>{:.science}

<aside>Well, until you discover quantum physics. Or circles. Bear with me here.
Rationals are good enough for things you'll directly encounter in the physical
world.</aside>{:.science}

The combination of whole numbers and fractions are enough to describe anything
in the physical world that you want to describe. You might contest that some
numbers can't be fully written out, like certain ratios pertaining to circles.
This is fine, because in the real world there's no such thing as a perfect
circle: and you can always get close enough with a fraction. In fact, the
fraction will probably be *closer* than whatever number you'd prefer to use
(rather irrationally), because the fraction can better capture the defects and
the inherent granularity in what you were assuming was a true circle.

In fact, these numbers are so good at describing everything in the physical
world that I'm going to refer to them as the <span>Physical
Numbers</span>{:.simplifience}.

<aside>Mathematicians call them "Rational Numbers". I don't care. Mathematicians
have stupid names for their numbers anyway.</aside>{:.simplifience}
