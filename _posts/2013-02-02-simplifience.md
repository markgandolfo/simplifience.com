title: What is Simplifience?
---
Math and Science are wrong.

Oh, they're not wrong as in incorrect (though they have drawn incorrect
conclusions before). They're wrong because they're *taught* wrong.

It's not their fault. Math is millennia -- more than 2,500 years -- old. It's
bound to pick up some historical <span>cruft</span>{:.define} along the way.

<aside markdown="1" class="define">
cruft _n._

Unnecessary complexities, unwanted excess.
</aside>

See, discoveries in science and mathematics are named long before they're
understood. It's as if scientists and mathematicians found a broad tree trunk
one day and named it "The Trunk". Centuries later, they discovered that they had
been feeling up an elephant the whole time.

Now the elephant is wandering around and we still refer to each individual leg
as "The Trunk" (even though there's more than one of them). To make matters
worse, laymen think that "The Trunk" refers to the elephant's *trunk* and not an
ignorant assessment of each individual *leg*, and nobody can be convinced that
the name is confusing and <span>wrong</span>{:.wrong}.

<aside class="wrong">
That's how it's always been, you see.
If it was good enough for Aristotle, why isn't it good enough for you?
</aside>

That will not happen here. <span>Simplifience</span>{:.simplifience} is about
understanding the universe in the simplest and most beautiful way possible.
We'll be leaving behind the cruft of history, the crutches of the past, the
mistakes of our forebearers.

<aside class="simplifience">
I will make errors, of course. I can only do my best.
</aside>

In fact, I'm not even going to *mention*{:.wrong} the true mistakes here. If you
haven't heard them already, I don't want to confuse you first before showing you
a better way. Because that's precisely the problem with science education today.

<aside markdown="1" class="wrong">
I might mention them out here, though. Red boxes are for wrong things. But even
here I won't *explain* them.
</aside>

See, scientists are usually confused for a long time between making new
discoveries and figuring out what's actually going on. And when we teach
science, we drag people through that confusion. We say

> Then, Famous Scientist #1 did experiment A, and look how crazy the result was!
> So then Famous Scientist #2 did experiment B, and look! That's crazy too!
> Nobody understood it!

We do this for *thirty years* worth of experimentation before showing students
how the experiments were based upon incorrect premises and that there's a
<span>simple</span>{:.simplifience} explanation that accounts for all the
madness.

<aside class="simplifience">
Simple, but perhaps mind-bending.
</aside>

![Look! A scientist!](/images/hugheverettiii.jpg)

We say things like

> My students aren't advanced enough to understand relativity yet,
> because they don't understand all of the context --

And then we go on teaching *wrong, old* science to all but the brightest of our
students.

So I'm *not* going to drag you through that mud. I'm going to tell you what
we've discovered, I'm going to show you how the universe works. I'm *not* going
to do it one experiment at a time: I'm going to tell you the conclusions. Every
so often I'll link in a description of an <span>experiment</span>{:.science}
that backs my claims.

<aside markdown="1" class="science">
In a little box that looks like this. This color is for *science boxes*.
</aside>

However, my goal here is not to convince you of how the world works. My goal
here is to tell you how the world works: there are [plenty of
resources](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/) on the internet to help you learn the
rigorous proofs. I plan to give you the context and the setting by which
to understand them.

In sum, my goal is thus:

- <span>Tell you what we, the human species, have learned about this strange
  and beautiful universe in which we live.</span>{:.simplifience} We have
  uncovered much of the incredible nature of the universe, but most of our
  discoveries are hidden behind rigorous proofs in archaic languages.
  This is a resource to teach you what we've learned of the universe
  [without]({{ "But what about rigor?" | page }}) requiring you to
  understand rigorously how we learned it.

<hr class="mark">

- <span>Tell it to you on simple, unforgiving terms.</span>{:.simplifience}
  I won't make concessions to history or poor decisions. I will give things
  names that make sense in the context that I use them. The names and the terms
  that I use will <span>not be compatible</span>{:.wrong} with mainstream
  science and mathematics, but they will be easier to understand.

<aside class="wrong">
Don't fret, I'll point out places where I'm incompatible &amp; tell you how the
rest of the world does things.
