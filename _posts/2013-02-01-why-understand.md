Why learn how the universe works?

Well, native curiosity, for one thing. You know how kids can't stop asking why?
You used to be a kid once. What happened to that feeling? I bet it's still
somewhere deep inside of you, if you dig far enough.

*Why* are we here? What's up with this whole <span>existence</span>{:.wrong}
thing, anyway?

<aside>And don't give me any spiritual or religious lines. Until we have some
way to know for sure, I'm not going to stop looking for the real
answers. They'll probably surprise us.</aside>{:.wrong}

If that's not enough of an answer for you, consider what knowledge of the
universe has given us so far. We can fly around the entire planet in a single
day and with minimal effort. We can contact friends halfway around the world in
the space of a thought. We can convene a symphony in our ears on demand and live
long lives without fear of disease.

We've literally discovered magic, only it's not magic to us, because we
understand it.

And the universe only gets more interesting. Did you know that you can time
travel to the future? That you can fly to the center of the galaxy in half
a second, even though it's 27,000 light years away? That gravity isn't a force?

We don't understand the universe yet, not deeply, but we understand *far* more
than most people think. Misconceptions about. People are still confused about
very well-established facts, thinking that they're still the <span>sticking
points</span>{:.science} of modern science. And people don't even *know* the
open questions that we currently face.

<aside>Entanglement and uncertainty, for instance. Don't worry, they'll be
intuitive by the time we're through.</aside>{:.science}

It doesn't help that these incredibly cool revelations are hidden behind opaque
walls of millennia-old mistakes in mathematics and centuries of confusing
scientific history.

That's no way to make new discoveries.

So let's get you up to speed. Who knows? You may be the one to have the next big
insight: but you can't do that unless you know where things stand today.
