title: The Beginning

The beginning is <span>Mathematics</span>{:.math}.

Don't panic. Mathematics is a beautiful subject. But if mathematics is like
music, we teach mathematics by forcing children to memorize Bethoven's sheet
music. We won't be doing any of that kind of mathematics here.

<!-- TODO: Animating golden ratio loop. Or a fractal. -->

> Mathematics is beautiful.

Consider: is <span>312571</span>{:.math} a prime number?

<aside>Don't tell me! I'd have to pick a new number.</aside>{:.math}

Wait! Don't go look it up. It doesn't matter.

What matters is this:

> there is an answer.

It's not an answer that's up for debate. 312571 is either prime or it's not.
Once I've told you how I write numbers and what 'prime' means, the answer is out
of my hands. It doesn't matter what I *want* to believe, or how well I argue.

Mathematics is the art of discovering things that are already decided.  It's the
art of laying down rules (whatever rules you want) and following those rules to
unexpected conclusions.

It's fun, if you have a hankering for that sort of thing. It's definitely cool.

<!-- TODO: Crazy fractals. -->

And we aren't going to do any of it.

You see, that's not why we care about mathematics here. Mathematics is great fun
in the way that any art form is great fun, but we're here to <span>understand
the universe</span>{:.simplifience}. What does math have to do with that?

It turns out that mathematics has *everything* to do with it. Math is the
language. It's the way that everything -- literally everything -- works.

At first this may seem strange. Does the world *really* care about nonsense like
"<span>imaginary</span>{:.wrong}" numbers or fractals? And what about flowers
and emotions and beauty?

<aside>I implore you: forget everything you've heard about
them.</aside>{:.wrong}

But it all boils down to math. And it makes sense, when you stop to consider.

See, the universe follows rules. It's these rules that *make* the universe
a universe, and not a chaotic mess where literally anything could happen next.
We expect the future to depend upon the past: that's a rule. Even buty and
emotion follow patterns, follow rules.

If we can look at these rules and understand them, we can
[do the impossible]({{ "Why Understand the World?" |page }}). We can predict the
world and, even better, *explore* the world to find out things that are true
whether or not we know them yet. We get to uncover the rules, *the* rules,
write them down, and then figure out what things are true.

As you'll remember, that's what <span>mathematics</span>{:.math} *is*.

It's no surprise that mathematics describes our world. Mathematics is the
description of rules, and <span>our world has rules</span>{:.math}.

<aside>In fact, you could argue that math <em>doesn't</em> always describe our world.
Math is constantly struggling to keep up with the incredible rules of the
universe as we uncover them.</aside>{:.math}

This is why we're going to start with mathematics. Mathematics lies at the very
core of the understanding of any system: it's *what we call* understanding
a system.

Of course, in the world at large, mathematics is much more than that. You can
study math for math's own sake. You can follow patterns to depths unachievable
and chase numbers to the end of infinity. Mathematicians will tell you that
*that's* mathematics. And they're right.

<aside>But in the end, if there are consistent rules for it, it's
math.</aside>{:.math}

But there is some core part of it, some subset, which is simply about
understanding a system. Simply about writing down the rules and seeing what
follows. That part is special.

That part is <span>simplifience</span>{:.simplifience}.
