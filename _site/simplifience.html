	<p>Math and Science are wrong.</p>

<p>Oh, they&rsquo;re not wrong as in incorrect (though they have drawn incorrect
conclusions before). They&rsquo;re wrong because they&rsquo;re <em>taught</em> wrong.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not their fault. Math is millennia &ndash; more than 2,500 years &ndash; old. It&rsquo;s
bound to pick up some historical <span class="define">cruft</span> along the way.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p>cruft <em>n.</em></p>

  <p>Unnecessary complexities, unwanted excess.</p>
</aside>

<p>See, discoveries in science and mathematics are named long before they&rsquo;re
understood. It&rsquo;s as if scientists and mathematicians found a broad tree trunk
one day and named it &ldquo;The Trunk&rdquo;. Centuries later, they discovered that they had
been feeling up an elephant the whole time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/elephant.png" alt="Blind monks" class="big" /></p>

<p>Now the elephant is wandering around and we still refer to each individual leg
as &ldquo;The Trunk&rdquo; (even though there&rsquo;s more than one of them). To make matters
worse, laymen think that &ldquo;The Trunk&rdquo; refers to the elephant&rsquo;s <em>trunk</em> and not an
ignorant assessment of each individual <em>leg</em>, and nobody can be convinced that
the name is confusing and <span class="wrong">wrong</span>.</p>

<aside class="wrong">
That's how it's always been, you see.
If it was good enough for Aristotle, why isn't it good enough for you?
</aside>

<p>That will not happen here. <span class="simplifience">Simplifience</span> is about
understanding the universe in the simplest and most beautiful way possible.
We&rsquo;ll be leaving behind the cruft of history, the crutches of the past, the
mistakes of our forebearers.</p>

<aside class="simplifience">
I will make errors, of course. I can only do my best.
</aside>

<p>In fact, I&rsquo;m not even going to <em class="wrong">mention</em> the true mistakes here. If you
haven&rsquo;t heard them already, I don&rsquo;t want to confuse you first before showing you
a better way. Because that&rsquo;s precisely the problem with science education today.</p>

<aside class="wrong">
  <p>I might mention them out here, though. Red boxes are for wrong things. But even
here I won&rsquo;t <em>explain</em> them.</p>
</aside>

<p>See, scientists are usually confused for a long time between making new
discoveries and figuring out what&rsquo;s actually going on. And when we teach
science, we drag people through that confusion. We say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then, Famous Scientist #1 did experiment A, and look how crazy the result was!
So then Famous Scientist #2 did experiment B, and look! That&rsquo;s crazy too!
Nobody understood it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do this for <em>thirty years</em> worth of experimentation before showing students
how the experiments were based upon incorrect premises and that there&rsquo;s a
<span class="simplifience">simple</span> explanation that accounts for all the
madness.</p>

<aside class="simplifience">
Simple, but perhaps mind-bending.
</aside>

<p><img src="/images/hugheverettiii.jpg" alt="Look! A scientist!" /></p>

<p>We say things like</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My students aren&rsquo;t advanced enough to understand relativity yet,
because they don&rsquo;t understand all of the context &ndash;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then we go on teaching <em>wrong, old</em> science to all but the brightest of our
students.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> going to drag you through that mud. I&rsquo;m going to tell you what
we&rsquo;ve discovered, I&rsquo;m going to show you how the universe works. I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> going
to do it one experiment at a time: I&rsquo;m going to tell you the conclusions. Every
so often I&rsquo;ll link in a description of an <span class="science">experiment</span>
that backs my claims.</p>

<aside class="science">
  <p>In a little box that looks like this. This color is for <em>science boxes</em>.</p>
</aside>

<p>However, my goal here is not to convince you of how the world works. My goal
here is to tell you how the world works: there are <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/">plenty of
resources</a> on the internet to help you learn the
rigorous proofs. I plan to give you the context and the setting by which
to understand them.</p>

<p>In sum, my goal is thus:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="simplifience">Tell you what we, the human species, have learned about this strange
and beautiful universe in which we live.</span> We have
uncovered much of the incredible nature of the universe, but most of our
discoveries are hidden behind rigorous proofs in archaic languages.
This is a resource to teach you what we&rsquo;ve learned of the universe
<a href="/stub.html">without</a> requiring you to
understand rigorously how we learned it.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="mark" />

<ul>
  <li><span class="simplifience">Tell it to you on simple, unforgiving terms.</span>
I won&rsquo;t make concessions to history or poor decisions. I will give things
names that make sense in the context that I use them. The names and the terms
that I use will <span class="wrong">not be compatible</span> with mainstream
science and mathematics, but they will be easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="wrong">
Don't fret, I'll point out places where I'm incompatible &amp; tell you how the
rest of the world does things.
