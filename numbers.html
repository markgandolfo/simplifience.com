			<p>So we start with mathematics. We&rsquo;re going to start from the very, very
beginning. You&rsquo;ve probably been taught things that are very wrong.</p>

<p>So, here&rsquo;s a question for you.</p>

<p>What are numbers?</p>

<p>No, seriously. <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meditation">Meditate</a> on it for
a moment.</p>

<aside class="info">I'll be prefixing meditations with "Meditation:" from now on. Pause and
whisper your answers out loud, first. You might be surprised.</aside>

<p>Honestly. I&rsquo;ll wait. Here&rsquo;s your old friend the number line, to look at while you think.</p>

<iframe width="480" height="300" src="mathbox/number-line.html"></iframe>

<p>Now.</p>

<p>Is ½ a number?</p>

<p>Surely, it is. It&rsquo;s one half. It&rsquo;s not a <em>whole</em> number, but it&rsquo;s still
a number, right?</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>Before I answer, consider this: You have four apples in a bowl. You can add
apples to the bowl and remove apples from the bowl. If you start with four and
add two, then you have six. If you proceed to eat ½, you have 5½ left over. So
½ certainly seems like it&rsquo;s a number.</p>

<p>Ok, now consider the restaurants on your way to work. Say there are four.
If two more open, then there will be six. Now, let&rsquo;s say that the largest
restaurant sells ½ its floor space to a boutique, and now it&rsquo;s the smallest
restaurant.</p>

<p>How many restaurants are there on your way to work after one sells half its space?</p>

<p>Still 6.</p>

<p>Wait a moment. ½ works for apples, but not restaurants? What do numbers have to
do with apples and restaurants? Is ½ a number, or isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meditation">Meditation</a>: Is ½ a number?
Why did it work on apples but not restaurants?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a trick question. ½ is sometimes a number, and sometimes it&rsquo;s not. It
depends <em>how much number</em> you&rsquo;re using.</p>

<hr class="mark" />

<p>You may be a bit <span class="simplifience">confused</span> right now.
Standard math education implies that numbers are sacred, and that they&rsquo;re
stuffed to the gills with weird features.
You start out with integers and then learn that there&rsquo;s negatives, then
fractions, then irrationals, and if you made it that far you get thoroughly
baffled by <span class="wrong">poorly-named additions</span>.</p>

<aside class="simplifience">
  <p><a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/if/your_strength_as_a_rationalist/">Embrace that feeling</a>.</p>
</aside>

<aside class="wrong">
  <p>Looking at you, &lsquo;imaginary numbers&rsquo;.
<br /><br />
As if some numbers are more concrete than others. Get real.</p>
</aside>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the case <em>at all</em>. Numbers aren&rsquo;t <em>physically real</em>, you see.
They&rsquo;re only useful when they&rsquo;re applied to a situation. So whether not ½ is a
number depends upon what situation it&rsquo;s being applied to.</p>

<p>Consider again the apple bowl above. It starts with four apples in it. Someone
comes and adds two more apples. How many apples are in the bowl?</p>

<p>Six, obviously. But why? Because four plus two is six? What does that have to do
with apples? Numbers are imaginary, after all. There&rsquo;s no such thing as
a &ldquo;two&rdquo; in the real world. If you ground up the entire universe,
there would be not a single iota of &ldquo;two&rdquo; to be found. Not anywhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Meditation">Meditation</a>: Then why are you
confident that there are six apples?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because <em>the apples are acting like numbers</em>.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how numbers act: they don&rsquo;t merge willy nilly or disappear into
thin air. They follow certain rules. And, <em>when apples are following the same
rules</em>, then things that are true about numbers are true about apples.</p>

<p>Notice, however, that apples don&rsquo;t act <em>exactly</em> like numbers. What if you wait
twenty years before putting the two new apples in the bowl? The original four
have rotted.  Or if someone eats an apple while you&rsquo;re waiting, you might only
have five at the end. Or perhaps the bowl has a hole in it! Or maybe someone
else is adding apples too, and you end up with <em>more</em> than six.</p>

<p>The point is, apples don&rsquo;t always act like numbers. But <em>when they do</em>, you can
use numbers <em>instead</em> of apples to answer your questions. This is <em>incredibly
useful</em>, because you don&rsquo;t have to re-invent addition the moment that you start
to crave oranges instead of apples.</p>

<p>And this brings us back to the elusive number ½. Is it a number? Well, <em>it
depends upon the situation</em>. Because remember, there&rsquo;s no such thing as real
numbers in the real world. So you have to ask yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are the things I&rsquo;m counting divisible into two?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there&rsquo;s a good analogy, like with apples, then ½ <span class="rigor">makes
sense</span>. If there&rsquo;s not, like with restaurants, then ½ is
meaningless. A restaurant can&rsquo;t be divided in half: it can expand and shrink,
but it&rsquo;s either a restaurant or it&rsquo;s not. ½ doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning.</p>

<aside class="rigor">Of course, you probably can't cut an apple perfectly in half, so you
can't trust all of the properties of ½ (the number) to hold for ½ (the apple).
It's all about how good your analogies are.</aside>

<p>Unless you <span class="info">invent a meaning for it</span>. Because <em>that&rsquo;s what
it&rsquo;s all about</em>. It&rsquo;s about finding patterns and figuring them out. It&rsquo;s about
learning something about a pattern and then applying it to everything else that
follows that pattern, even if imperfectly.</p>

<aside class="info">I know you pedants are already doing this. "What about a restaurant
that's open half the hours? Or half the days of the week? Or only at night?
Or..."</aside>

<p>So numbers are just another tool. They&rsquo;re a pattern that is, admittedly,
everywhere. But most things in our daily lives don&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> act like perfect
numbers. Apples can be eaten. Clouds merge and flow into each other. Cars break
down. Sure there are some pure numbers around &ndash; money, for instance, is
something that we designed to act like theoretical numbers. And computers are
heavily dependant upon pretending that an imperfect electrical signal is
actually a perfectly &ldquo;true&rdquo; number.</p>

<p>But these are man-made things, fashioned after the mythical &ldquo;number&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve
conceived. Is there anything in nature, any fundamental thing, that <em>truly</em> acts
like a number?</p>

<p>And, if so, how much number does it act like?</p>
