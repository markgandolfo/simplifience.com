	<p>The beginning is <span class="math">Mathematics</span>.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t panic. Mathematics is a beautiful subject. But if mathematics is like
music, we teach mathematics by forcing children to memorize Bethoven&rsquo;s sheet
music. We won&rsquo;t be doing any of that kind of mathematics here.</p>

<!-- TODO: Animating golden ratio loop. Or a fractal. -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Mathematics is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider: is <span class="math">312571</span> a prime number?</p>

<aside class="math">Don't tell me! I'd have to pick a new number.</aside>

<p>Wait! Don&rsquo;t go look it up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>What matters is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is an answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an answer that&rsquo;s up for debate. 312571 is either prime or it&rsquo;s not.
Once I&rsquo;ve told you how I write numbers and what &lsquo;prime&rsquo; means, the answer is out
of my hands. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I <em>want</em> to believe, or how well I argue.</p>

<p>Mathematics is the art of discovering things that are already decided.  It&rsquo;s the
art of laying down rules (whatever rules you want) and following those rules to
unexpected conclusions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun, if you have a hankering for that sort of thing. It&rsquo;s definitely cool.</p>

<!-- TODO: Crazy fractals. -->

<p>And we aren&rsquo;t going to do any of it.</p>

<p>You see, that&rsquo;s not why we care about mathematics here. Mathematics is great fun
in the way that any art form is great fun, but we&rsquo;re here to <span class="simplifience">understand
the universe</span>. What does math have to do with that?</p>

<p>It turns out that mathematics has <em>everything</em> to do with it. Math is the
language. It&rsquo;s the way that everything &ndash; literally everything &ndash; works.</p>

<p>At first this may seem strange. Does the world <em>really</em> care about nonsense like
&ldquo;<span class="wrong">imaginary</span>&rdquo; numbers or fractals? And what about flowers
and emotions and beauty?</p>

<aside class="wrong">I implore you: forget everything you've heard about
them.</aside>

<p>But it all boils down to math. And it makes sense, when you stop to consider.</p>

<p>See, the universe follows rules. It&rsquo;s these rules that <em>make</em> the universe
a universe, and not a chaotic mess where literally anything could happen next.
We expect the future to depend upon the past: that&rsquo;s a rule. Even buty and
emotion follow patterns, follow rules.</p>

<p>If we can look at these rules and understand them, we can
<a href="/why-understand.html">do the impossible</a>. We can predict the
world and, even better, <em>explore</em> the world to find out things that are true
whether or not we know them yet. We get to uncover the rules, <em>the</em> rules,
write them down, and then figure out what things are true.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;ll remember, that&rsquo;s what <span class="math">mathematics</span> <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that mathematics describes our world. Mathematics is the
description of rules, and <span class="math">our world has rules</span>.</p>

<aside class="math">In fact, you could argue that math <em>doesn't</em> always describe our world.
Math is constantly struggling to keep up with the incredible rules of the
universe as we uncover them.</aside>

<p>This is why we&rsquo;re going to start with mathematics. Mathematics lies at the very
core of the understanding of any system: it&rsquo;s <em>what we call</em> understanding
a system.</p>

<p>Of course, in the world at large, mathematics is much more than that. You can
study math for math&rsquo;s own sake. You can follow patterns to depths unachievable
and chase numbers to the end of infinity. Mathematicians will tell you that
<em>that&rsquo;s</em> mathematics. And they&rsquo;re right.</p>

<aside class="math">But in the end, if there are consistent rules for it, it's
math.</aside>

<p>But there is some core part of it, some subset, which is simply about
understanding a system. Simply about writing down the rules and seeing what
follows. That part is special.</p>

<p>That part is <span class="simplifience">simplifience</span>.</p>
