			<p>The beginning is Mathematics.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t panic. Mathematics is a beautiful subject. But if mathematics is like
music, we teach mathematics by forcing children to memorize Bethoven&rsquo;s sheet
music. We won&rsquo;t be doing any of that kind of mathematics here.</p>

<!-- TODO: Animating golden ratio loop. Or a fractal. -->

<blockquote>
  <p>Mathematics is beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider: is <span class="maths">312571</span> a prime number?</p>

<aside class="maths">Don't tell me! I'd have to pick a new number.</aside>

<p>Wait! Don&rsquo;t go look it up. It doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>

<p>What matters is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is an answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not an answer that&rsquo;s up for debate. 312571 is either prime or it&rsquo;s not.
Once I&rsquo;ve told you how I write numbers and what &lsquo;prime&rsquo; means, the answer is out
of my hands.
<span class="info">It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I <em>want</em> to believe, or how well
I argue</span>.</p>

<aside class="info">
  <p>You&rsquo;ll notice this is also a property of reality. No matter how hard you
believe you can fly, you can&rsquo;t jump off of a cliff.
<br />
<br />
However, you <em>can</em> learn the rules and build an airplane. That&rsquo;s what
this is all about.</p>
</aside>

<p>Mathematics is the art of discovering things that are already decided.  It&rsquo;s the
art of laying down rules (whatever rules you want) and following those rules to
unexpected conclusions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s fun, if you have a hankering for that sort of thing. It&rsquo;s definitely cool.</p>

<!-- TODO: Crazy fractals. -->

<p>And we aren&rsquo;t going to do any of it.</p>

<p>You see, that&rsquo;s not why we care about mathematics here. Mathematics is fun in
the way that any art form is fun, but we&rsquo;re here to <span class="simplifience">understand the
universe</span>. What does math have to do with that?</p>

<p>It turns out that mathematics has <em>everything</em> to do with it. Math is the
language. It&rsquo;s the way that everything &ndash; literally everything &ndash; works.</p>

<p>Many people rebel at hearing this. The universe can&rsquo;t run on math! What about
flowers and emotions and beauty?</p>

<p><img src="/images/flower1.jpg" alt="Hartmann Linge, Bergstraße, Wikimedia Commons" /></p>

<p>Those people are looking at it all wrong.</p>

<p>See, the universe follows rules. It&rsquo;s these rules that <em>make</em> the universe
a universe, and not a chaotic mess where literally anything could happen next.
Without rules, you might wake up tomorrow morning and be a tomato.</p>

<p>We believe we&rsquo;re likely to wake up tomorrow, that the sun is likely to rise
tomorrow, and that sunrise will still be beautiful tomorrow. These are rules.
And <span class="maths">mathematics is a language for formulating rules</span>.</p>

<aside class="maths">
  <p>An often obtuse language, mind you. That&rsquo;s half the reason we&rsquo;re here.</p>
</aside>

<p>If we can look at these rules and understand them, we can
<a href="/why-understand.html">do the impossible</a>. We can predict the
world and, even better, <em>explore</em> the world to find out things that are true
whether or not we know them yet. We get to uncover the rules, <em>the</em> rules,
write them down, and then figure out what things are true.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;ll remember, that&rsquo;s what mathematics <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that mathematics describes our world. Mathematics is the
description of rules, and <span class="maths">our world has rules</span>.</p>

<aside class="maths">In fact, you could argue that math <em>doesn't</em> always describe our world.
Math is constantly struggling to keep up with the incredible rules of the
universe as we uncover them.</aside>

<p>This is why we&rsquo;re going to start with mathematics. Mathematics lies at the very
core of the understanding of any system: it&rsquo;s <em>what we call</em> understanding
a system.</p>

<p>Of course, in the world at large, mathematics is much more than that. You can
study math for math&rsquo;s own sake. You can follow patterns to depths unachievable
and chase numbers to the end of infinity. Mathematicians will tell you that
<em>that&rsquo;s</em> mathematics. And they&rsquo;re right.</p>

<p>We only want a little bit of mathematics. We want the parts that describe the
rules, the parts that tell us what things are true before we learn them. What we
want is <span class="define">simplifience</span>.</p>

<aside class="define">
  <p>Simplifience. <em>n.</em>
<br />
1. Describing the rules of existence, and extrapolating them to learn things
   that are true.</p>
