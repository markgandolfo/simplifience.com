Behold the deepest question ever asked: [*Why?*]({{ "Why?" | page }}){:.why}

<span>Why</span>{:.why} is the sky blue? <span>Why</span>{:.why} does the world
spin? <span>Why</span>{:.why} are we here? *Why?*{:.why}

This question has been at the front of our minds since first we conceived of
questions, and it will haunt us until the universe fades.

Humankind has hounded this question since the dawn of thought, and we've made
incredible progress: progress which is inadequately taught.

<span>Science</span>{:.science} is coupled with its history, dragging students
through the same confusion our predecessors faced.
<span>Mathematics</span>{:.math} is reduced to memorization, hiding the deep
answers it bears.

<span>Simplifience</span>{:.simplifience} is neither. It is a quest to
understand the universe.
