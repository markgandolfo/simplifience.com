Behold the deepest question ever asked: *Why?*

Why is the sky blue? Why does the world spin? Why are we here? *Why?*

This question has been at the front of our minds since first our minds could
ask, and it will haunt our minds until the universe fades and dies.

Humankind has hounded this question forever, and we've made incredible progress:
progress which is inadequately taught.

Science is coupled with its history, dragging students through the same
confusion our predecessors faced.

Mathematics is reduced to memorization, hiding the deep answers it bears.

Simplifience is neither. It is a quest to understand the unvierse.
